STIMULATION EXAMPLES

This script can be used to run stimulation on a MaxTwo or
MaxOne system via the Python API. Several combinations of pulse
trains can be run and the script can be called from the command
line directly.

Warning: No recordings are made in this example, but you can find
an example about how to record in another script, called `recordings.py`.

    The stimulation units can be controlled through three independent

    By programming a DAC channel with digital values, we can control
    the output the stimulation units. DAC inputs are in the range between
    0 to 1023 bits, whereas 512 corresponds to zero volt and one bit
    corresponds to 2.9 mV. When the stimulation buffers are set to voltage
    mode, they act like an inverting amplifier, hence 512 + a number of bits corresponds to a negative voltage, or 512 - a number of bits corresponds to a positive voltage.
    corresponds to a negative voltage. Thus, to give a pulse of 100mV,
    the DAC channel temporarily would need to be set to 512 - 34 (100mV/2.9)

    -----
    In this example, all 32 units are controlled through the same DAC
