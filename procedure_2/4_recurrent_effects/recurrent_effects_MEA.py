# Description: Biocomputing with Brainoware
#              Procedure 2 - Reservoir computing hardware properties
#              4. Recurrent effects (with MEA recording)
#              This script describes recurrent effects of organoid
#              reservoir computing with single or multiple pulses.
#              This is the recording-enabled version of recurrent_effects_MEA.py: it wraps
#              the stimulation in a maxlab.Saving() recording so the responses are saved.
